# iterator and composite pattern

Iterator pattern allows us to go through the date without knowing how the data
is stored.

Composite pattern allows us to build our structure of the objects as `tree` and
traverse them easily.

Combine iterator and composite pattern, we can have different implementation of
component in the composition pattern, but still be able to traverse the whole
tree using the iterator interface.
